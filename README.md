This is only the final code, without the Dataset.


### The Project

Our goal was to predict sleep quality based on heart rate data. The dataset provided information about sleep duration, heart rate, and the corresponding sleep phases. Using this data, we applied machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised approaches, to analyze and model the relationship between these variables and sleep quality.

By leveraging these techniques, we aimed to gain insights into how physiological factors, like heart rate, can influence or indicate the overall quality of sleep, and to develop a reliable predictive framework for assessing sleep patterns.
